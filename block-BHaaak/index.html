                    Rajgir, meaning the abode of Gods, is a town in Nalanda district about 93 km southeast of Patna. It finds mention in the Mahabharata as the kingdom of Jarasandha, the arch nemesis of Krishna and his Yadava clan. While the exact date of Rajgirâ€™s foundation is not known, the city is believed to be about 3000 years old. Rajgir is divided into two parts: one which is fortified and surrounded by seven hills and the other, which is believed to have been founded by King Bimbisaraâ€™s son, Ajatshatru. There are two local beliefs about the name of the town. One belief is that the town gets its name from the Hindi word  rajgriha which means royal house and the other states that the name comes from the rajgir (also a Hindi word), which means royal mountain.

                  <h3>History of Rajgir</h3>
                  <p>
                    Rajgir remained the capital of Magadha Empire till the 5th century BC when Ajatshatru made Pataliputra the capital of his kingdom. King Jarasandha was slain by Bhima in an epic wrestling match. An arena known as Jarasandhaâ€™s Akhada stands at the place where it is believed the wrestling match took place. Besides the Mahabharata, the town has also been mentioned in ancient scriptures of the Jains and Buddhists as well as in diaries of Buddhist travelers who visited the region during the Mauryan era.
